				<h4 id="this-is-a-civilized-place-for-public-discussion">This is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					Please treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared
					community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.
				</p>
				<p>
					These are not hard and fast rules, merely guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this
					a clean and well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.
				</p>
				<h4 id="improve-the-discussion">Improve the Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way,
					however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try
					again later.
				</p>
				<p>
					The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of
					the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.
				</p>
				<p>
					One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the
					topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share
					your interests.
				</p>
				<h4 id="be-agreeable-even-when-you-disagree">Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree</h4>
				<p>
					You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not
					people. Please avoid:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Name-calling</li>
					<li>Ad hominem attacks</li>
					<li>Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content</li>
					<li>Knee-jerk contradiction</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.</p>
				<h5 id="your-participation-counts">Your Participation Counts</h5>
				<p>
					The conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this
					community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding
					those that do not.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our forum and website provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst)
					contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own
					experience, and everyone else’s, too.
				</p>
				<p>Let’s leave our community better than we found it.</p>
				<h5 id="if-you-see-a-problem-flag-it">If You See a Problem, Flag It</h5>
				<p>
					Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help,
					moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your
					energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either
					automatically or by moderator intervention.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account
					for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no
					responsibility for any content posted by the community. New members are approved for forum use when they sign
					up for an account.
				</p>
				<h5 id="always-be-civil">Always Be Civil</h5>
				<p>Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
					</li>
					<li>Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.</li>
					<li>
						Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
					</li>
					<li>Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					These are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If
					you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York
					Times.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe
					for family and friends.
				</p>
				<h5 id="keep-it-tidy">Keep It Tidy</h5>
				<p>
					Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning
					up. So:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Don’t start a topic in the wrong category.</li>
					<li>Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.</li>
					<li>Don’t post no-content replies.</li>
					<li>Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.</li>
					<li>Don’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button.</p>
				<h5 id="post-only-your-own-stuff">Post Only Your Own Stuff</h5>
				<p>
					You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software,
					video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.
				</p>
				<h5 id="powered-by-you">Powered by You</h5>
				<p>
					This site is operated by your friendly local staff and you, the community. If you have any further questions
					about how things should work here, open a new topic in the site feedback category and let’s discuss! If
					there’s a critical or urgent issue that can’t be handled by a meta topic or flag, contact us via the staff
					page.
				</p>
				<h5 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h5>
				<p>
					Yes, legalese is boring, but we must protect ourselves – and by extension, you and your data – against
					unfriendly folks. We have a Terms of Service describing your (and our) behavior and rights related to content,
					privacy, and laws. To use this service, you must agree to abide by our TOS.
