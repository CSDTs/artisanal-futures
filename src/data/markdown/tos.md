#### Enforcement

ArtisanalFutures may investigate and prosecute violations of these terms to the fullest legal extent. ArtisanalFutures may notify and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting violations of the law and these terms.

ArtisanalFutures reserves the right to change, redact, and delete content on the forum for any reason. If you believe someone has submitted content to the forum in violation of these terms, contact us immediately.

#### Your Account

You must create and log into an account to use some features of the forum.

To create an account, you must provide some information about yourself. If you create an account, you agree to provide, at a minimum, a valid e-mail address, and to keep that address up-to-date. You may close your account at any time by e-mailing support@artisanalfutures.org.

You agree to be responsible for all action taken using your account, whether authorized by you or not, until you either close your account or notify ArtisanalFutures that your account has been compromised. You agree to notify ArtisanalFutures immediately if you suspect your account has been compromised. You agree to select a secure password for your account, and keep it secret.

ArtisanalFutures may restrict, suspend, or close your account on the forum according to its policy for handling copyright-related takedown requests, or if ArtisanalFutures reasonably believes that you’ve broken any rule in these terms.

#### Your Content

Nothing in these terms gives ArtisanalFutures any ownership rights in intellectual property that you share with the forum, such as your account information, posts, or other content you submit to the forum. Nothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in ArtisanalFutures’s intellectual property, either.

Between you and ArtisanalFutures, you remain solely responsible for content you submit to the forum. You agree not to wrongly imply that content you submit to the forum is sponsored or approved by ArtisanalFutures. These terms do not obligate ArtisanalFutures to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit, and to change it, according to these terms.

Content you submit to the forum belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others for it. But at a minimum, you license ArtisanalFutures to provide content that you submit to the forum to other users of the forum. That special license allows ArtisanalFutures to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the forum.

When content you submit is removed from the forum, whether by you or by ArtisanalFutures, ArtisanalFutures’s special license ends when the last copy disappears from ArtisanalFutures’s backups, caches, and other systems. Other licenses you apply to content you submit, such as Creative Commons licenses, may continue after your content is removed. Those licenses may give others, or ArtisanalFutures itself, the right to share your content through the forum again.

Others who receive content you submit to the forum may violate the terms on which you license your content. You agree that ArtisanalFutures will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.

#### Your Responsibility

You agree to indemnify ArtisanalFutures from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account on the forum. Both you and ArtisanalFutures agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify ArtisanalFutures as soon as possible. If ArtisanalFutures fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won’t have to indemnify ArtisanalFutures for damages that you could have defended against or mitigated with prompt notice. You agree to allow ArtisanalFutures to control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify ArtisanalFutures, and to cooperate with those efforts. ArtisanalFutures agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.

#### Disclaimers

You accept all risk of using the forum and content on the forum. As far as the law allows, ArtisanalFutures and its suppliers provide the forum as is, without any warranty whatsoever.

The forum may hyperlink to and integrate forums and services run by others. ArtisanalFutures does not make any warranty about services run by others, or content they may provide. Use of services run by others may be governed by other terms between you and the one running service.

#### Limits on Liability

Neither ArtisanalFutures nor its suppliers will be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages their personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.

As far as the law allows, the total liability to you for claims of any kind that are related to the forum or content on the forum will be limited to $50.

#### Feedback

ArtisanalFutures welcomes your feedback and suggestions for the forum. See the Contact section below for ways to get in touch with us.

You agree that ArtisanalFutures will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide, and that ArtisanalFutures won’t have to notify you that your feedback was used, get your permission to use it, or pay you. You agree not to submit feedback or suggestions that you believe might be confidential or proprietary, to you or others.

#### Termination

Either you or ArtisanalFutures may end the agreement written out in these terms at any time. When our agreement ends, your permission to use the forum also ends.

The following provisions survive the end of our agreement: Your Content, Feedback, Your Responsibility, Disclaimers, Limits on Liability, and General Terms.

#### Disputes

The Artisanal Futures Collective Agreement will govern any dispute related to these terms or your use of the forum.

You and ArtisanalFutures agree to seek injunctions related to these terms only in state or federal court in Oklahoma City, OK. Neither you nor ArtisanalFutures will object to jurisdiction, forum, or venue in those courts.

Other than to seek an injunction or for claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, you and ArtisanalFutures will resolve any dispute by binding American Arbitration Association arbitration. Arbitration will follow the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. Arbitration will happen in Ann Arbor, MI. You will settle any dispute as an individual, and not as part of a class action or other representative proceeding, whether as the plaintiff or a class member. No arbitrator will consolidate any dispute with any other arbitration without ArtisanalFutures’s permission.

Any arbitration award will include costs of the arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for witnesses. You and ArtisanalFutures may enter arbitration awards in any court with jurisdiction.

#### General Terms

If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. Otherwise, that provision should be removed.

You may not assign your agreement with ArtisanalFutures. ArtisanalFutures may assign your agreement to any affiliate of ArtisanalFutures, any other company that obtains control of ArtisanalFutures, or any other company that buys assets of ArtisanalFutures related to the forum. Any attempted assignment against these terms has no legal effect.

Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.

These terms embody all the terms of agreement between you and ArtisanalFutures about use of the forum. These terms entirely replace any other agreements about your use of the forum, written or not.

#### Contact

You may notify ArtisanalFutures under these terms, and send questions, at support@artistanalfutures.org.

ArtisanalFutures may notify you under these terms using the e-mail address you provide for your account on the forum, or by posting a message to the homepage of the forum or your account page.

#### Changes

ArtisanalFutures last updated these terms on August 3, 2022, and may update these terms again. ArtisanalFutures will post all updates to the forum. For updates that contain substantial changes, ArtisanalFutures agrees to e-mail you, if you’ve created an account and provided a valid e-mail address. ArtisanalFutures may also announce updates with special messages or alerts on the forum.

Once you get notice of an update to these terms, you must agree to the new terms in order to keep using the forum.
